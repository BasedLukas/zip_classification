## Gzip implementation

This project is a simplified implementation of the gzip compression algorithm. The code here is used in my blogpost, which can be found [here](https://loreley.one/2023-07-gzip/).

Run `main.py` in order to test the algorithm and view the output at various stages of compression.

The `gzip_classification.py` file makes use of gzip as a text classifier. I explain how this is possible in the blog post. It is based on a paper entitled "Less is More: Parameter-Free Text Classification with Gzip".
